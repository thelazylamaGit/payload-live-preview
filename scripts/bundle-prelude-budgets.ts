// 12 gzip and up to 128 brotli bytes. Lean omits precise fragment planning.

// 2026-10-09: fragment and route recovery plus two bounded transient retries.
// Ceilings move by the measured increase over an isolated HEAD build on the
// same Node 22.22.3 host; existing compression cushions are preserved.

// 2026-10-10: direct Lexical text-leaf fingerprints and conservative node-move
// detection. Exceeded ceilings move by exact before/after Node 22.22.3
// measurements, preserving existing cushions; other ceilings stay fixed.
// Full runtime: +663 raw / +216 gzip (level 9) / +197 brotli bytes.
// Lean: +78 raw / +23 gzip / +13 brotli bytes for tracker state only.

// 2026-10-10: cherry-pick without keyed-child fragment targeting.
// Rebased ceilings preserve existing margins; exceeded dimensions use the
// resulting build plus 20 raw / 12 gzip / 128 brotli bytes.
