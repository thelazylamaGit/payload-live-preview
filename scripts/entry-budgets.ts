// Budgets include narrow headroom for patch-level correctness fixes while still

// 2026-09-18 (2.0.3 release build): brotli is not byte-stable across hosts — CI compressed
// index.js 2 B over a budget 46 B above the local figure. One sweep, no per-row log: brotli
// keeps ~120 B over this host's measurement, gzip at least 12 B (1.9 % on a small file); raw unchanged.
export const ENTRY_BUDGETS: Readonly<Record<string, BundleBudget>> = {
  // 2026-09-12 (Testlauf B, F1): every row that embeds the runtime moves by the
  // measured difference, cushions kept — +287 B raw in an adapter, +400 in core
  // and client, +687/+689 in the barrels. The reason is in bundle-budgets.ts.
  // Adapter rows raised twice on 2026-08-27, measured with ~1 % headroom:
  // +~200 B gzip when the four adapters moved onto the shared preview policy
  // (one decision path per bundle costs more than straight-line code the
  // minifier could fold), then +~1.2 KB gzip for the authorization gate —
  // authorizePreview, strict-mode checks, the defaults profile, the development
  // warnings, and the runtime's source policy embedded in every adapter bundle.
  // The HMAC/session code is not in these bundles; the brand check is imported
  // from the `types` leaf for exactly that reason. 2026-08-27 (1.3.0): the keyed
  // morph (ADR 0008), its diagnostics and the template sanitizer options add
  // ~1.4 KB gzip to the inline runtime and therefore to every adapter bundle. core.* rows: +~200 B gzip for
  // the message bus source policy (eventSourcePolicy), same date. 2026-09-04:
  // +~45 B gzip in every adapter that embeds the runtime, for the reveal ledger
  // fix recorded in bundle-budgets.ts. 2026-09-05: +~70 B gzip in every bundle
  // that embeds the runtime, for the per-instance sanitizer policy (see
  // bundle-budgets.ts); astro +~285 B for `authorizePreview` on the fragment
  // endpoint and `LivePreviewLocals`, the other adapters +~70–120 B for the
  // type-bound locals writes and the shared CSP helper; migrate.js and
  // doctor-cli.js +~170/+~75 B for the `rename-admin-origins-option` codemod;
  // server.* +~50 B for the entry split into a barrel and `preview.ts`;
  // index.js brotli lowered towards its measurement. Brotli is not byte-stable:
  // CI compressed index.js 45 915 and then 45 959 B from byte-identical raw
  // and gzip output, 56–100 B over this host. Every brotli row therefore keeps
  // about 120 B over the local figure, still under the 2 % the improvement
  // hint allows; raw and gzip rows stay tight because they reproduce.
  //
  // 2026-09-06: every row that embeds the inline runtime rises by the ~660 B
  // gzip `onUnboundChange` costs it (see bundle-budgets.ts) — the adapters, the
  // client, core and the root barrel. The Next row additionally carries
  // `livePreviewScriptProps()`, a few dozen bytes. `doctor-cli.js` moves for the
  // runtime source it embeds for its readiness probe, nothing of its own.
  //
  // 2026-09-06 (fragment endpoint for Next.js): the Next row rises ~10 KB raw /
  // ~3.1 KB gzip because that entry now carries the fragment endpoint —
  // authorization, the protocol parser, limits, the registry lookup. It is the
  // same code the Astro entry already carried; a project that never imports
  // `createFragmentEndpoint` does not ship it — the `createLivePreviewMiddleware`
  // fixture in check-tree-shaking.ts measures ~2.4 KB gzip less than this row. The Astro row rises ~200 B raw for the module boundary the
  // move introduces (the endpoint no longer inlines into its one caller).
  //
  // 2026-09-06 (fragment endpoint for SvelteKit and Nuxt, `preview.boundary()`):
  // those two adapter rows rise ~10 KB raw / ~3 KB gzip for the endpoint they
  // now carry, exactly as the Next row did — a project that never imports
  // `createFragmentEndpoint` still ships none of it. `core.*`, `index.*` and
  // `server.*` rise ~650 B raw / ~270 B gzip for `createPreviewBindings().boundary()`:
  // the registry-id and key checks, and the attribute record it builds.
  //
  // 2026-09-06 (Ü9, the lean runtime): `lean.*` are new rows — the second
  // artifact as a value, which is almost entirely the embedded script. It sits
  // behind its own subpath so only a project that imports it carries those
  // bytes; behind a `profile: 'lean'` option instead, the same artifact landed
  // in every adapter entry and measured +24 KB gzip each. Every row that embeds
  // the runtime rises ~90 B raw for the profile's own code: the LP0104 message,
  // the renderers that report it, and the two strategy warnings the lean build
  // keeps as shared functions.
  //
  // 2026-09-06 (Ü11): every row that embeds the runtime carries the LP0503
  // message with it (see bundle-budgets.ts); `fragment.js` moves for the
  // strategy warnings it now shares with the runtime.
  //
  // 2026-09-06 (R5, `delivery: 'asset'`): every adapter entry rises ~500 B gzip.
  // The bootstrap source and the asset descriptor now sit in the shared script
  // path, so all four adapters can serve the runtime as a cached file instead
  // of embedding it — Astro's own loader mode reads the same descriptor rather
  // than a second copy. These are server bundles; the bytes this buys back are
  // the ~38 KB gzip a preview page no longer carries on its second load. The
  // `lean.*` rows rise ~100 B gzip for the artifact's own two digests, without
  // which it could be embedded but never served.
  //
  // 2026-09-06 (R6): the SvelteKit and Nuxt rows rise ~270 B gzip for their own
  // asset routes — the shared response builder was already in the bundle, so
  // this is the route shape each framework wants and nothing more.
  //
  // 2026-09-06 (R8, the build-time annotator): `annotate.js` is a new row and a
  // small one — the plugin is the scanner plus a rewrite, and the scanner is
  // regular expressions. It carries no ts-morph, which is the reason it is an
  // entry of its own rather than part of `./codegen`.
  //
  // 2026-09-06 (LP0409): every row that embeds the runtime rises ~450 B raw /
  // ~130 B gzip for the message the strict sanitizer prints when it removes an
  // attribute the 1.x `'compat'` default kept. Found by upgrading a real 1.8.1
  // consumer: a `data-*` hook driving a CSS selector disappeared on the first
  // write, with nothing said anywhere. The bytes buy the one thing an upgrade
  // could not otherwise discover except by looking.
  //
  // 2026-09-07 (LP-1, the relationship tracker): every row that embeds the
  // runtime rises +431 B raw / ~120 B gzip / ~110 B brotli, and the root barrel
  // +835 B raw because it carries the runtime twice — as code and as the string
  // the generator embeds. The bytes are an identity for Payload's document event
  // and the comparison against the document the message previews. The panel
  // fills `externallyUpdatedRelationship` from `mostRecentUpdate`, which every
  // save of the previewed document raises and nothing clears, so the old
  // `typeof x === 'object'` read a level as an edge and left `skipUnchanged` off
  // for the rest of the session. Replaying the recorded 3.88 session: four
  // `relationshipUpdate` events become none, thirteen post-save writes are
  // skipped that were not. See bundle-budgets.ts for the full reason and for the
  // third of the bytes that is the id comparison.
  //
  // Only two rows exceeded a raw or gzip ceiling and only those two are raised
  // there: `lean.cjs` 81 454 → 81 690 raw / 25 607 → 25 680 gzip (measured
  // 81 561 / 25 631) and `lean.js` 81 443 → 81 680 / 25 602 → 25 670 (measured
  // 81 550 / 25 625). The lean artifact is the smallest thing that carries the
  // whole runtime, so it is where a fixed number of bytes shows first.
  //
  // The brotli rows below are not paid for by new code. They restore the ~120 B
  // cushion this file has documented since 2026-08-27 and which the raise above
  // consumed on every row that embeds the runtime: `adapters/astro/index.js`
  // 38 808 → 38 990, `adapters/astro/middleware-entry.js` 35 247 → 35 380,
  // `adapters/nextjs/index.js` 38 391 → 38 510, `adapters/nuxt/index.js`
  // 38 293 → 38 410, `adapters/sveltekit/index.js` 38 011 → 38 090, `client.cjs`
  // 30 437 → 30 520, `client.js` 30 411 → 30 510, `core.cjs` 32 125 → 32 250,
  // `core.js` 32 102 → 32 200, `index.cjs` 49 801 → 49 910, `index.js`
  // 49 744 → 49 910, `lean.cjs` 22 776 → 22 870, `lean.js` 22 768 → 22 870.
  // Three of those (`astro/index.js`, `core.cjs`, `index.js`) had crossed; the
  // rest were between 6 and 42 B under their ceiling, which is not a budget but
  // a coin flip — brotli does not reproduce on this host: three builds from
  // byte-identical raw and gzip output measured 49 731, 49 758 and 49 785 B for
  // `index.js`. Raw and gzip rows stay tight because they do reproduce.
  //
  // 2026-09-07 (LP-2, keeping a block the registry cannot render): every row
  // that embeds the runtime rises +672 B raw / ~250 B gzip / ~190 B brotli, the
  // `lean.*` rows +643, `core.*` and `client.*` +685 (they carry the source as
  // well), and the root barrel +1 357 because it carries the runtime twice — as
  // code and as the string the generator embeds. `lexical.*` rise +239 raw for
  // LP0410 alone; the write path that keeps the markup is not in that entry.
  // The reason is in bundle-budgets.ts: an empty `<div class="lp-block ...">`
  // was being written over the `<figure><img></figure>` the project's own server
  // had rendered for the block, so a title edit deleted the image from the
  // preview. Only the rows that crossed a ceiling are raised, and only to their
  // measurement plus the cushion this file already documents — raw and gzip
  // tight because they reproduce, brotli ~120 B (~1 % on the two small
  // `lexical.*` rows, where 120 would be 2.4 % of the artifact).
  //
  // Corrected 2026-09-07 (Z19). Two notes above blame brotli for a build that
  // was not reproducible. Brotli is deterministic; the artifact was not.
  // `RUNTIME_BUILD_INFO.generatedAt` held a wall clock, and `index.js` and
  // `index.cjs` are the only two entries that carry it — same raw length, same
  // gzip, six different bytes, which is a substitution only brotli can see. The
  // two CI figures quoted at the top (45 915, then 45 959) are that same effect
  // on that same file, not two answers from one compressor.
  // `npm run build:runtime` now derives SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH from the tested commit,
  // the way `.github/workflows/build.yml` already did, so two builds of one
  // commit are byte-identical on a developer machine as well.
  //
  // Three rows kept cushion that only the noise had justified and go back to
  // their measurement plus the documented ~120 B: `adapters/nextjs/index.js`
  // 38 720 → 38 690 (measured 38 567), `client.cjs` 30 710 → 30 700 (30 572),
  // `index.cjs` 50 220 → 50 160 (50 035). The other rows that raise had lifted —
  // `adapters/nuxt`, `adapters/sveltekit`, `client.js`, `core.js`, `lean.*` —
  // already sit between 100 and 125 B over their measurement: LP-2's real growth
  // spent what LP-1 had banked, and there is nothing left there to take back.
  //
  // The cushion itself stays, for the one difference this host cannot measure:
  // the brotli library in CI's Node. Node 22.22.1 and 24.19.0 compress these
  // artifacts to the same byte here — both ship brotli 1.2.0 — so it may be
  // worth nothing, but that is a measurement for a machine that can see both
  // sides, not a reason to shave every row now.
  //
  // 2026-09-07 (Z3, escalate instead of degrade): every row that embeds the
  // runtime rises +1 303 B raw / ~440 B gzip / ~390 B brotli, the `lean.*` rows
  // +907 (no strategy runner, so no escalation to carry), and the root barrel
  // +2 720 raw because it carries the runtime twice — as code and as the string
  // the generator embeds. `doctor.js`, `fragment.cjs` and `plugins.*` move by
  // +25 raw / ~14 gzip and nothing else: that is the one new entry in the frozen
  // diagnostic table, LP0411, which those entries import whole.
  //
  // The reason is in bundle-budgets.ts. Three facts the runtime already had and
  // discarded — a renderer that refused its value, a Lexical block whose server
  // markup the write had to drop, a changed field with no anchor — now decide
  // whether a strategy should draw the region instead of leaving a patch the
  // server would not have produced. Only the rows that crossed a ceiling are
  // raised, and only to their measurement plus the cushion this file documents:
  // raw and gzip tight because they reproduce (Z19), brotli ~120 B.
  //
  // `doctor.js` keeps its brotli row: 4 762 measured against 4 803, it did not
  // cross. `fragment.js` and `plugins.*` did not cross at all.
  //
  // 2026-09-07 (Z4, merge only when it adds something): every row that embeds
  // the runtime rises +2 712 B raw / ~830 B gzip / ~700 B brotli, the root
  // barrel +5 418 raw because it carries the runtime twice. Thirteen rows
  // crossed; every other row is untouched, because nothing outside the runtime
  // moved.
  //
  // This is the largest single raise in this file, and it is the only one so far
  // that buys a request back rather than a behaviour. Until now every accepted
  // message cost one authenticated POST to Payload's REST API — 18 messages, 18
  // requests, in all five scenarios the interaction budget measures, and 19 of
  // them on a page that had not a single binding to render the answer into. A
  // plain text field now costs none of them, a page nobody binds costs none, and
  // a burst on a relationship or a rich-text field costs two: one that opens it
  // and one that closes it. The bytes are the decision that tells those apart
  // (`src/core/merge-need.ts`) and the window a burst shares; the reasoning is in
  // bundle-budgets.ts.
  //
  // 2026-09-07 (Z5, the write that opens a quiet phase): every row that embeds
  // the runtime rises +172 B raw / ~50 B gzip / ~50 B brotli, `core.*` and
  // `client.*` +167, and the root barrel +339 raw because it carries the runtime
  // twice. Thirteen rows crossed a raw ceiling; three of them also crossed one
  // other metric (`adapters/sveltekit/index.js` brotli, `index.cjs` brotli,
  // `lean.cjs` gzip) and nothing else moved. Only the metrics that crossed are
  // raised, each to its measurement plus the cushion this file documents.
  //
  // The bytes are one timestamp, one comparison and one branch in the scheduler.
  // They buy 50 ms: a keystroke that used to wait out the whole debounce before
  // anything reached the DOM — 66.6 ms p95 in the jsdom interaction gate — now
  // lands on the next frame at 16.6 ms, and the window it opens still coalesces
  // the burst behind it. See bundle-budgets.ts for why it is in the runtime.
  //
  // 2026-09-07 (Z6, the route brake stops swallowing the change): every row that
  // embeds the runtime rises +331 B raw / ~120 B gzip / ~80 B brotli, the root
  // barrel +1 381 raw because it carries the runtime twice, `fragment.*` +167
  // raw for the route strategy's own half, and `adapters/react/index.js` +375
  // raw for `<LivePreviewRouteRefresh />` and the slot it writes. Sixteen rows
  // crossed; nothing else moved.
  //
  // The runtime's share is two things. A refresh the strategy refuses because it
  // is inside its own minimum interval is now handed back and run once when the
  // interval closes, instead of being dropped — the audit measured two unbound
  // changes 286 ms apart and the second one never reached the preview at all.
  // And the refusal is counted apart from a failure, because a single number for
  // "paused on purpose" and "broken" is a number nobody can read.
  //
  // The react row's share buys the risk back: the route strategy morphs fetched
  // HTML into the living page, which on a Next page is DOM React's reconciler
  // owns, and a component that lends the runtime `router.refresh` replaces both
  // the morph and the HTML request with a re-render the framework performs
  // itself. See bundle-budgets.ts for the runtime half.
  //
  // The three small rows (`fragment.*`, `adapters/react/index.js`) take ~60 B of
  // brotli cushion rather than the ~120 the large ones do: 120 is 2.5 % of a
  // 4.8 KB file, which the improvement notice rightly calls slack.
  //
  // 2026-09-07 (Z7, LP0201 one level down): every row that embeds the runtime
  // rises +244 B raw / ~80 B gzip / ~55 B brotli, `core.*` and `client.*` +251,
  // and the root barrel +495 because it carries the runtime twice. Thirteen
  // rows crossed a raw and a gzip ceiling; four of them also crossed brotli.
  // Nothing outside the runtime moved.
  //
  // The bytes are the descent: a group nothing on the page addresses is opened
  // once and its scalars are reported under the path a binding would carry, so
  // an edit to `admission.priceFrom` is named instead of silently doing nothing.
  // The reasoning and the limits (one level, no arrays) are in bundle-budgets.ts.
  //
  // Two brotli rows that did not cross are raised with them:
  // `adapters/nextjs/index.js` 40_040 → 40_140 and `lean.cjs` 24_130 → 24_240.
  // The growth left them 21 and 14 B under their ceiling, and a row that close
  // is not a budget — it is the coin flip this file already refused once, for
  // the one difference this host cannot measure (the brotli library in CI's
  // Node). Every other brotli row still sits 60 B or more under.
  //
  // 2026-09-07 (Z22, an item rebuilt from a template keeps what the template
  // cannot carry): every row that embeds the runtime rises +448 B raw / ~430 B
  // gzip / ~200 B brotli, `core.*` and `client.*` +430, the root barrel +876
  // because it carries the runtime twice, and `structural.*` +523 — that entry
  // is the applier itself, so the change is a larger share of it. Eleven rows
  // crossed all three metrics and `structural.*` two; `lean.*` hold on every
  // one, because the lean artifact carries neither array renderer and pays only
  // the 25 B of shared attribute rule.
  //
  // The bytes buy the class of defect the runtime cannot see: a write that
  // succeeds and still differs from the server's markup. An item rebuilt from
  // `data-payload-array-template` carried what the author wrote and nothing the
  // framework's compiler had put around it — Astro's `data-astro-cid-…`, Vue's
  // `data-v-…`, Svelte's class — so the patched list lost its scoped styling
  // while every check passed. See bundle-budgets.ts; the acceptance is the
  // fidelity oracle green with that exception deleted.
  //
  // 2026-09-10 (Z20, LP0412): +851 B raw in every row that embeds the runtime,
  // +1 729 in `index.*` because that barrel carries it twice, +820 in `lean.*`
  // and +30 in the rows that carry only the diagnostic-code table
  // (`doctor.js`, `fragment.*`, `plugins.cjs`). `core.cjs` brotli and every
  // `structural.*`, `lexical.*`, `server.*` and `plugins.js` row still hold and
  // are left where they were — only what actually broke is raised. The
  // reasoning for the bytes is in bundle-budgets.ts; the short version is that
  // the runtime now says out loud, once per binding, that it wrote a different
  // reading of a date or a number than the template did.
  //
  // `core.cjs` brotli is the exception to "only what broke": it measured 33 932
  // against a ceiling of 33 935 and held, then 33 997 from byte-identical raw
  // and gzip output on the next build. Brotli is not byte-stable here — the
  // note above says so for the same reason — so it goes to 34 120, the usual
  // ~120 B over the measurement, rather than back onto a three-byte margin.
  //
  // 2026-09-10 (Z9, auto-binding): every row that embeds the runtime rises
  // +3 913 B raw / ~1 360 B gzip / ~1 170 B brotli, `index.*` about twice that
  // because the barrel carries the runtime as code and as the string the
  // generator embeds, `lean.*` +~450 raw / ~200 gzip for the option slot, the
  // marker the cache reads, the two inspection fields and the LP0104 line —
  // the search itself is not in the lean artifact — and `plugins.*` +~550 raw
  // / ~150 gzip for the overlay's second heading. Measured against the same
  // build without the change; the reason for the bytes, and the way to get
  // them back, is in bundle-budgets.ts. Every crossed row goes to its
  // measurement plus the usual cushion (raw ~110, gzip ~50, brotli ~130); a
  // metric that still held is left where it was.
  //
  // 2026-09-10 (Z25, the diagnostic table leaves the runtime): every row that
  // embeds the runtime falls −1 287 B raw / ~−520 B gzip / ~−370–450 B brotli,
  // `index.*` −1 302 because the barrel carries the runtime as the string the
  // generator embeds as well. The bytes were the frozen `DIAGNOSTIC_CODES`
  // record, pulled into the inline runtime since Z6 by one property read in
  // the strategy runner (see bundle-budgets.ts). Seven rows go down to their
  // new measurement plus the cushion this file documents: the four adapters,
  // the Astro middleware entry and the two root barrels. `client.*` and
  // `core.*` export the table themselves and moved by 11–15 B raw, `lean.*`
  // never carried it, `doctor-cli.js` embeds an artifact that did not change;
  // all of those stay where they were.
  //
  // 2026-09-10 (Z26, a route refresh keeps the guesses): every row that embeds
  // the runtime rises +910 B raw / ~+300 B gzip / ~+230 B brotli, `client.*`
  // and `core.*` +1 000, `index.*` +1 910 because the barrel carries the
  // runtime twice, `lean.*` +115 for the state slot and the folded method —
  // the search stays out of that artifact. Fifteen rows crossed; the two
  // `lean.*` brotli rows held and stay. What the bytes buy is in
  // bundle-budgets.ts: a guess that used to be gone after the first route
  // refresh, and a refresh per keystroke after that, is looked for again on
  // the fresh markup instead. Each crossed metric goes to its measurement plus
  // the cushion this file documents.
  //
  // 2026-09-11 (Z28, the trusted core's mutation run): every row that embeds
  // the runtime falls −819 B raw / ~−140 B gzip / ~−40–180 B brotli, `index.*`
  // −1 639 because the barrel carries the runtime twice, the React and Vue
  // rows −648 raw / ~−90 gzip for the bus and the merger they carry,
  // `lexical.*` −144 and `structural.*` −154 for the escape and URL helpers.
  // The bytes were lines no test could reach — guards a later check repeated,
  // a fallback nothing could hit, probes a call makes itself; the list is in
  // bundle-budgets.ts. All 19 rows that moved go down to their measurement
  // plus the cushion each carried; the brotli rows that embed the runtime keep
  // at least the ~130 B the epoch swing above asks for.
  //
  // 2026-09-11 (Z30, the block verdict spoken by the write): every row that
  // embeds the runtime rises +764 B raw / ~+183 B gzip / ~+100–250 B brotli
  // (`client.*` and `core.*` +836, which carry the source as well; `index.*`
  // +1 600, the runtime twice), `lexical.*` falls −124 raw / ~−43 gzip — the
  // warn-once left the node renderer for the write — and `doctor.js`,
  // `fragment.*` and `plugins.*` move +29 raw for the frozen table's new row
  // (LP0413). The bytes are the two texts and the verdict behind them, the
  // listener the render context carries to the block renderer, and the three
  // counters `inspect().fidelity` reads; see bundle-budgets.ts. Every row goes
  // to its measurement plus the cushion it carried; the brotli rows that embed
  // the runtime keep at least the ~130 B the epoch swing above asks for.
  //
  // 2026-09-11 (Z29, the pairing descends into the template's wrapper): every
  // row that embeds the runtime rises +293 B raw / ~+93 B gzip / ~+30–110 B
  // brotli (`client.*` and `core.*` +326 with the source, `index.*` +619 for
  // the runtime twice); nothing else moves. The bytes are the one function
  // that recognises a `<div class="prose">` around a rich-text field and its
  // two guards — the tag list, and the comparison against the rendered
  // document's own top-level elements — so the block-keeping write pairs
  // where the blocks are and the wrapper stays; see bundle-budgets.ts. Every
  // row to its measurement plus the cushion it carried, brotli at least ~130.
  //
