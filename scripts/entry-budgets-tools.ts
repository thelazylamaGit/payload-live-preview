  // 2026-09-12: the parser loads `ts-morph` through `createRequire` on first use
  // instead of importing it, because a static import made `pll-codegen --help`
  // answer with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND in a project that had not installed the
  // optional peer. No new code — one different load path — and every entry that
  // ships the parser pays ~270 B raw for it: the loader, its one sentence, and
  // the guard indirection. Each moved row to its measurement plus the cushion
  // (raw ×1.001, gzip ×1.0014, brotli +100); none of these embeds the runtime,
  // so the epoch cannot move them. `codegen.js`'s brotli ceiling still holds
  // (measured 4 888) and stays where it is. `codegen-cli.js` is unchanged and
  // passes at 20 055 / 6 948 / 6 260 — the dynamic import tried first cost
  // 1 885 B raw there, because materialising the barrel's namespace defeats the
  // tree-shaking a named import allows, and it did not even work: esbuild hoists
  // an external import to the top of the bundle out of a dynamically imported
  // module too, so the binary went on resolving the peer before its first flag.
