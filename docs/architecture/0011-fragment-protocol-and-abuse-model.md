# ADR 0011 — The fragment protocol and its abuse model

**Status:** Accepted • **Date:** 2026-08-27

Planned as "ADR 0005 (fragment protocol and abuse model)" before that number
was taken by plugin ownership.

## Context

Patching (ADR 0008) brings unsaved form state into server-rendered HTML
without a reload, as long as the markup that shows a field already exists.
It cannot create a section a template renders only when a field is set,
compute a derived value, or run a component's own logic. The hybrid preview
planned for 1.7.0 asks the real component renderer to do that for one
boundary at a time — which means a browser asking a server to render
something from request-controlled data, on behalf of an editor. That is
the part that needs a threat model before an endpoint.

## Decision

Recovery addendum (2026-10-09): unfinished fragment renders survive superseding
snapshots, including identical snapshots and boundaries without patch fields.
Interrupted route requests are carried into the next revision. After saved
route HTML replaces the DOM, affected fragments replay the latest resolved
unsaved document, independently of merge refinement's edit diff and within
the message's owner scope. Ordinary edits retain the direct patch fast path.

Transient fragment failures (`LP0801`, including timeouts) keep their render
debt and receive at most two automatic retries, 200 ms apart, using the latest
resolved state. Supersession and shutdown cancel the retry timer. Protocol and
authorization failures receive no automatic retry. Exhausted failures remain
incomplete and visible through failure events and inspection counters; a
later accepted snapshot can attempt the owed render again. Binding fallback
still runs, but does not prove that the whole fragment is current.

### 1. Markup and runtime contract

- A boundary is an element with `data-payload-fragment="<id>"`; `<id>` is a
  registry key (`[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}`, case-insensitive), never a path,
  module or function name. `data-payload-fragment-key` distinguishes several
  boundaries of one id; `data-payload-depends="a,b"` limits which fields
  re-render it (none: every update does).
- The runtime core carries a **seam**, not the client: `strategies.fragment`
  plans which boundaries a revision touches and receives a context with the
  capabilities it may use — morph (Trusted Types and the keyed morph apply),
  the fallback patch of the boundary's own bindings, and event reporting —
  plus the revision's abort signal. Bindings inside a planned boundary are
  not patched; the boundary is the server's. Measured: the seam costs the
  plain inline runtime +1 050 B gzip (24 936 → 25 986); the client is a small prelude the
  generator emits ahead of the runtime only for a page with `fragments`
  (`src/fragment/inline.ts`, looked up as `__LIVE_PREVIEW_FRAGMENT__`), so a
  patch-only page carries none of it and every page shares one runtime.
- The client (`payload-live-preview/fragment`) posts one request per
  boundary and revision, shares identical requests, caps concurrency (4),
  times out (5 s), validates the response (JSON, shape, size, boundary id,
  revision) and maps every failure to an `LP08xx` outcome. A superseded
  revision aborts its requests; a late response is discarded by revision;
  a failure is patched from the same revision's data, so the editor never
  sees stale content presented as current, and slow fragment A can never
  overwrite fast fragment B.
- Events: `fragmentRender` per boundary and revision (`rendered` /
  `failed` with the code); `afterUpdate` with `source: 'fragment'` once
  the revision's fragments settled; `error` with `context: 'fragment'`.
  `inspect().fragments` reports handler presence and counts.

### 2. Wire protocol (`@/types/fragment-protocol`, version 1)

Request: `POST <endpoint>` on the page's own origin, `application/json`,
`credentials: same-origin`, header `x-payload-fragment-version: 1`, body
`{ fragment, key?, route, search, revision, locale?, collectionSlug?,
globalSlug?, fields }` — `route` and `search` are the page's own, so the
server authorizes the fragment request exactly as it would the page.
Response: `{ html, boundary: { id, key? }, revision, metadata: {
renderedAt, renderer, durationMs? } }` with `Cache-Control: private,
no-store`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Vary: Cookie`. A refusal is a
status and one generic word (`{"error":"unauthorized"}`), never a reason.

### 3. Server contract (`createFragmentEndpoint`, Astro first)

The endpoint renders only what its **registry** names: `{ [id]: {
component, props(input) } }`. Props are computed by the server from the
input (fields, locale, slugs, route, the authorized context); nothing in
the request selects code, templates, import paths or filesystem paths.
The default renderer is Astro's container API (`astro/container`,
created once per process); a `render` override exists for tests and other
component systems. Static-only deployments cannot serve it: fragments
need a server (an Astro SSR adapter or a separate preview rendering
service); the docs say so.

### 4. Abuse model — and where each control is verified

| Threat                                                 | Control                                                                                                                                                   | Verified in                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSR injection (request chooses what runs)              | Registry lookup by id only (own properties; prototype names refused); props computed server-side; no paths, templates or code cross the wire.             | `astro-fragments.test.ts` (404 for unknown/prototype ids) |
| Confused deputy (site renders for a non-editor)        | `authorizePreviewRequest()` with the site's strategy on the **page route + query** the client reports, under the request's own cookies/headers.           | 403 without a token, 403 for a token of another route     |
| Token leakage                                          | The token travels only as it already does for the page (query/cookie); responses are `no-store`; refusals carry no detail.                                | headers asserted on every response                        |
| Cross-site request forgery                             | `Sec-Fetch-Site` must be `same-origin`/`none`; `Origin` must match the page origin or an explicit allow-list; JSON content type required.                 | 403 cross-site / foreign origin; 415 non-JSON             |
| Amplification / resource exhaustion                    | Body limit (64 KiB), field depth limit (12), render timeout (5 s), client concurrency cap (4) and dedupe; rate limiting is the deployment's (documented). | 413 / 400 / 500 on timeout; client concurrency test       |
| Cross-tenant access (a token for document A renders B) | The authorized context's scope is checked against the request (locale today; collection/id when the strategy carries them).                               | `scopeAllows` in the endpoint                             |
| Stale content shown as current                         | Revision-bound requests, abort on supersession, fallback patch on failure, visible `LP08xx` code.                                                         | `fragment-strategy.test.ts`, `client.test.ts`             |

### 5. What stays out

- No unsigned query-only fragment endpoint: authorization is mandatory.
- No generalisation to other frameworks' endpoints before the Astro one has
  run against a real admin in three engines (the 1.7.0 release gates). The
  client option `fragments` is framework-neutral because the policy engine
  is; only the Astro endpoint helper exists.
- The morph never crosses an island: a boundary inside `astro-island` or
  `data-payload-island` is never planned.

2026-09-17 (2.0.2): the Astro endpoint helper is not the only one.
`createFragmentEndpoint` is exported by `payload-live-preview/nextjs`,
`payload-live-preview/sveltekit` and `payload-live-preview/nuxt` as well, each
a binding of the shared handler in `src/adapters/shared/fragment-endpoint.ts`.

## Consequences

- A page opts in per boundary; everything else keeps patching.
- The plain inline runtime grew by the seam (recorded in
  `scripts/bundle-budgets.ts`); the inline script with the prelude is a
  separate budget, and the adapter bundles carry the prelude once.
- Deployments that render fragments need a server. The docs list the
  requirements and the rate-limit guidance.

## Route strategy (1.7.0)

A binding in `<head>` or one marked `data-payload-strategy="route"` refreshes
the whole route once per revision (`src/fragment/route.ts`): a same-origin
GET with `x-payload-live-preview: route`, the head synced, `<body>` morphed
with the top-level boundaries keyed (`data-payload-fragment`,
`data-payload-island`) so they pair by identity, scroll restored, then the
revision re-applied. One refresh per revision and a 1 s minimum interval,
both `LP0805`. Focus survival through a whole-route refresh is covered by
the route unit test (jsdom); the browser E2E asserts the route refresh
itself — content, head title, scroll, and `route.refreshes` — because a
focused control's survival across a full-document morph is engine-sensitive
and the fragment path (which is what a focused editor field sits in) keeps
focus in all three engines.

## Addendum (2026-10-03): table depth and stricter endpoint caps

The reported Lexical table in PR #120 nests 15 levels under `fields`. The
previous ceiling of 12 refused that document before authorization. The default
ceiling is now 64; projects can lower it with `limits.fieldDepth`, an integer
from 0 to 64. A zero cap accepts an empty `fields` record only. Each object
property or array element adds one level, including primitive values, starting
at zero for `fields`. This is the serialized document's shape, separate from
Payload REST population depth.

The fixed ceiling still bounds the walk before authorization. Invalid endpoint
configuration throws when the endpoint is created; the internal parser returns
`null` for an invalid cap. A deeper request answers
`400 {"error":"field-depth","maxDepth":64}`, with the configured lower cap when
present. That public diagnostic reveals the cap before authorization. It does
not include fields, credentials, registry contents or the measured input depth.
Other shape, origin and authorization refusals retain their existing codes and
generic bodies. Response cache, content-type, protocol and `nosniff` headers
remain unchanged.

This addendum narrows the earlier rule that every refusal carries one word:
depth refusal additionally names the configured cap. The client continues to
treat HTTP 400 as `LP0801` and patches from the same revision. Protocol version 1
and the successful response shape stay unchanged. The new lower-cap option is
a minor release change.

The reported fixture and `astro-fragments.test.ts` cover the original table,
64/65, stricter caps and a serialized 20,000-level request before authorization.
The parser and shared binding contracts also check mixed object/array edges,
zero and invalid caps, and the refusal headers on all four adapters.
