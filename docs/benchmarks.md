# Benchmarks

Hot-path timings from `npm run test:bench -- --run` (Vitest bench, jsdom,
Node 24.18, 2026-08). jsdom is not a browser — read these as **relative
regression signals**, not absolute browser timings. Refresh this table when
touching the cache, scheduler, message bus, sanitizer, or Lexical renderer.

| Hot path                                          |   ops/sec |     mean |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------: | -------: |
| `resolveFieldValue` — 4-level nested path         | 7,467,094 |  0.13 µs |
| `diffArray` — 100 items (insert + remove + moves) |   254,369 |   3.9 µs |
| `escapeHtml` — ~2 KB string                       |   132,718 |   7.5 µs |
| No-listener `elementUpdate` path — 300 bindings   |   768,610 |   1.3 µs |
| `lexicalToHtml` — 30 paragraphs with links        |     1,556 | 0.643 ms |
| `sanitizeHtml` — ~2 KB mixed document             |     1,169 | 0.856 ms |
| Ordered async token pipeline — 1,000 messages     |       518 | 1.931 ms |
| `ElementCache.buildFromRoot` — 300 bound elements |       216 | 4.633 ms |

Interpretation for a live-editing session: a keystroke triggers field
resolution (~µs), possibly a Lexical render + sanitize (~1.5 ms for a
sizeable rich-text field), and a scheduler flush. The dominant cost —
cache building — happens once at startup and after DOM mutations, not
per keystroke; 300 bindings build in ~4.6 ms. Dotted-path lookup validates every
segment as an own, pollution-safe property and still completes in about 0.13 µs.
Each measured representative operation on the per-keystroke path stays comfortably
below a 60 fps frame budget (16.7 ms), even in jsdom, which is substantially slower
than real browser DOM implementations. These isolated measurements do not promise a
whole-update bound for pages that render many expensive bindings in one revision.

## Update-to-paint in a real browser

`npm run test:browser-bench` (Playwright, Chromium, `playwright.bench.config.ts`)
measures the whole chain on the 300 / 1,000 / 5,000-binding scenario pages:
from the host's `postMessage` to the first animation frame after the bound
element changed, one changed field per message. The frame's MutationObserver
supplies the mutation time and the following `requestAnimationFrame` the paint
proxy — the earliest instant the new text can be on screen, not the
compositor's own timestamp. 200 samples per scenario after 20 warm-up
messages; the fixture's debounce is 25 ms.

Whether a sample pays that 25 ms depends on when it arrives. Since 2026-09-07
the first write of a quiet phase skips the window and the rest of the burst
waits for it. Since 2026-09-10 the spec waits out the window between samples,
so every measured message is the first of a quiet phase — a keystroke after a
pause, which is what an editor actually does. It asserts that cadence rather
than assuming it: the smallest gap between two messages must exceed the
fixture's debounce, read from the fixture's own config.

Before that pause the spec sent the next message the instant the previous one
had painted, so the gap was the driver's own round trip — 5 to 30 ms against a
25 ms window. Every sample but the first was therefore a burst message, and on
which side of the window it fell depended on how loaded the machine was. That
is why the 2026-08-27 and 2026-09-07 tables below disagree with each other and
with the one after them: they measured the driver as much as the runtime.

Measured 2026-08-27 on the maintainer host. The fixture sets no
`skipUnchanged`, so it runs under the runtime's default, `true`:

| Bindings |     p50 |     p95 |     max | mutation p95 | budget (p95) |
| -------: | ------: | ------: | ------: | -----------: | -----------: |
|      300 | 18.6 ms | 39.6 ms | 41.2 ms |      22.8 ms |       100 ms |
|    1,000 | 30.3 ms | 44.9 ms | 87.6 ms |      28.1 ms |       100 ms |
|    5,000 | 43.0 ms | 64.3 ms | 83.9 ms |      40.6 ms |       100 ms |

Re-measured 2026-09-07, four runs, on the same host: 27.1–27.4 ms p50 and
34.3–34.7 ms p95 at 300 bindings, 28.8–29.8 / 52.3–52.7 at 1,000, and
42.8–44.1 / 49.0–52.8 at 5,000. One further run, on a cold machine whose driver
round trip ran longer than the 25 ms window, measured 15.3 / 22.5 at 300
bindings — that is the same page with the leading write actually exercised, and
the reason the paragraph above says what the cadence decides.

Re-measured 2026-09-10 on a faster host, with the pause, three runs. The
"before" column is the same host and the same three runs without it, and it is
the spread rather than the median that the pause fixes:

| Bindings | before (3 runs, p50/p95)          | after (3 runs, p50/p95)           |
| -------: | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
|      300 | 13.8/31.0 · 21.2/38.8 · 20.8/38.0 | 9.2/19.2 · 10.0/19.5 · 9.8/19.4   |
|    1,000 | 23.5/36.7 · 24.1/35.5 · 23.5/36.5 | 6.5/12.3 · 5.6/11.6 · 6.4/11.8    |
|    5,000 | 16.4/31.0 · 16.4/30.3 · 16.3/30.2 | 16.0/20.1 · 15.7/19.9 · 16.2/20.3 |

The 5,000-binding row barely moves because its driver round trip was already
longer than the window — those samples were quiet-phase messages by accident,
which is also why that page used to measure _faster_ than the 1,000-binding one.

One caveat on the absolute figures, which the pause did not introduce and does
not fix: the post time is read in the host document and the paint time in the
preview frame, and the two do not share a time origin. The frame's is later by
however long its navigation took — 6.4 ms on this host, and different per
scenario page — so every number here is low by that much. It was inside the
noise while the samples were bursts; at these latencies it is not, and a
mutation p95 can come out negative.

The p50 grows with the page because every binding is resolved on every message
even though one changed. `skipUnchanged`, on in the fixture, skips rendering
the unchanged ones, not that resolution and comparison. The scheduled deep-quality job runs this nightly as a **trend** and
keeps ninety days of reports; it asserts only that every sample produced a
measurement, because timing on a shared runner is not a fact a pull request
should fail on.

## `skipUnchanged` — what a keystroke costs with and without it

`tests/benchmarks/skip-unchanged.bench.ts` (Vitest bench, jsdom): one message
carrying 300 fields of which one changed, on a page with 300 bindings, awaiting
the flush's `afterUpdate`. jsdom's `requestAnimationFrame` is a ~16 ms timer,
so every figure includes that floor; the difference between the columns is the
work.

| Population             | off, mean | on, mean | work removed |
| ---------------------- | --------: | -------: | -----------: |
| 300 text bindings      |   22.7 ms |  17.8 ms |         ~4 × |
| 300 rich-text bindings |   98.5 ms |  18.9 ms |        ~30 × |

Two findings from getting these numbers right. The first version of this
bench awaited a `setTimeout(0)` and reported ~1.6 ms in both modes: the
scheduler flushes on `requestAnimationFrame`, so it was timing message dispatch
alone. And the first identity sorted object keys, which allocates a fresh
object per node: 0.685 ms for 300 small Lexical documents against 0.110 ms to
render them — the comparison cost six times the work it was avoiding. Plain
`JSON.stringify` is 0.153 ms for the same 300, and a reordered object simply
counts as changed, which is the safe direction.

## Structural updates: keyed morph versus replace

`tests/benchmarks/hot-paths.bench.ts`, "structural apply — morph versus
replace". Pre-seeded 100-item `<ul>` containers; the sample is one update.
What the morph keeps and what it never crosses is
[ADR 0008 — Keyed morph](architecture/0008-keyed-morph-ownership.md).

| Case                     | replace  | morph    | Δ             |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| one of 100 items changed | 0.425 ms | 0.455 ms | +7 % (~30 µs) |
| 100 items reordered      | 0.357 ms | 0.361 ms | within noise  |

The morph keeps the live element and edits it; the difference on a changed
item is the attribute diff and child walk that retention costs. Measured
2026-08-27 in jsdom; a trend, not a gate.

## Tree shaking — what one import costs

Measured 2026-09-14 with `npm run test:treeshake` (`scripts/check-tree-shaking.ts`):
a one-line consumer imports one symbol, Vite bundles it against the built
package resolved through `node_modules` (so `exports` and `sideEffects`
apply as after `npm install`), minified, gzip level 9. The budget is the gzip
ceiling the script enforces.

| Consumer imports                                                 | gzip     | budget |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `escapeHtml` from `payload-live-preview`                         | 210 B    | 214    |
| `lexicalToHtml` from `payload-live-preview`                      | 5,043 B  | 5,045  |
| `initLivePreview` from `payload-live-preview`                    | 44,601 B | 44,621 |
| `generateInlineScript` from `payload-live-preview`               | 42,223 B | 42,252 |
| `initLivePreview` from `payload-live-preview/core`               | 44,579 B | 44,599 |
| `lexicalToHtml` from `payload-live-preview/lexical`              | 5,175 B  | 5,178  |
| `morphElement` from `payload-live-preview/structural`            | 1,469 B  | 1,493  |
| `createLivePreviewMiddleware` from `payload-live-preview/nextjs` | 47,466 B | 47,500 |
| `LEAN_RUNTIME` from `payload-live-preview/lean`                  | 29,188 B | 29,203 |
| `useLivePreviewDocument` from `payload-live-preview/react`       | 5,100 B  | 5,180  |
| `useLivePreviewDocument` from `payload-live-preview/vue`         | 5,096 B  | 5,176  |
| `PluginManager` from `payload-live-preview/plugins`              | 3,315 B  | 3,372  |

Before this measurement existed, every row was 64 KB gzip: the root barrel
did not tree-shake at all. Three causes, all fixed in the same change:

1. esbuild's `keepNames` — implemented with top-level helper statements a
   consumer's bundler cannot prove pure. Name preservation now happens in
   the terser pass with the public allow-list (`scripts/build-dist.ts`), so
   `fn.name` on exported classes and functions is unchanged.
2. Minification in esbuild strips `/* @__PURE__ */` annotations (114 in the
   root bundle) that Rollup needs to drop unused constructions. esbuild now
   only bundles; terser minifies with `preserve_annotations`.
3. Import-time side effects in the library: the built-in renderer table
   (object spreads at module scope), Lexical node registration by
   `register()` calls at import, and an eager `new TextEncoder()`. Each is
   now a pure table or created on first use.

Rollup's `experimentalLogSideEffects` reports no remaining top-level side
effect in the source graph; the gate keeps it that way.

## Generic CSS bindings with manual fragment permissions

Measured locally on 2026-10-11, Node 22.22.3 on Windows. The baseline is an
untouched checkout of fork HEAD (`37a8081`), rebuilt with the same repository
scripts and installed toolchain. These are preview runtime costs; public
responses continue to suppress bindings and runtime delivery.

| Inline profile | Baseline gzip | Current gzip |        Increase |
| -------------- | ------------: | -----------: | --------------: |
| Full           |      39,665 B |     41,326 B | 1,661 B (4.19%) |
| Lean           |      30,048 B |     31,292 B | 1,244 B (4.14%) |
| With fragments |      43,465 B |     45,092 B | 1,627 B (3.74%) |

Full raw size increased from 126,826 to 131,693 bytes; Brotli increased from
34,823 to 36,242 bytes. The net change replaces the hex-only renderer with a
generic CSS renderer, bounded formatting/value validation and multiple binding
destinations. Explicit boundary `patchFields` permissions remain; automatic
coverage inference and a separate CSS writer branch are removed. Boundary
metadata is indexed during the binding scan, while fragment selection uses the
existing planner. That index can also serve future child-fragment planning;
keyed child selection is not part of this change.

The initial prototype added 1,961 gzip bytes. Simplification reduced that to
1,671; restoring manual permissions and the renderer pipeline gives 1,661.
Removing inference alone is therefore not a substantial compressed-size saving.
The remaining growth is measurable; this is not evidence of a minimum size.
Byte ceilings preserve their original cushions over paired measurements.

The focused CSS/permission microbenchmark is
`tests/benchmarks/css-bindings.bench.ts`. Manual patch permissions already
required precise path diffing in the old fork, so the ordinary/detailed diff
comparison is an absolute cost, not a new cost attributable to generic CSS.
Measured in one worker: about 3.35 million substitutions/validations and
2.52 million cached permission checks per second. Ordinary versus detailed
diffing took 0.0023 versus 0.0349 ms at 10 blocks, and 0.0198 versus 0.3506 ms
at 100 blocks. These are absolute synthetic timings, not a paired speedup over
the old implementation. They do not measure browser paint or network latency.

This revision ran the affected runtime, CSS/security, permission, Lexical,
scheduler replay, ownership/recovery, observer and DSL suites: 175 tests in
11 files, with at most two workers. The full unit, integration and browser
suites were not repeated. Typecheck, lint, bundle and architecture checks are
also reported separately. The earlier Windows timer/symlink issues remain
outside this change. API regeneration still exposes the same replay-store link
warnings and forgotten-export baseline mismatch seen in the untouched fork.

## Nested keyed fragments: incremental measurement

This step builds on the completed generic CSS/manual permission version above.
It reuses that boundary cache, precise path diff, keyed morph and per-boundary
work scheduler. It adds no exported names or source modules; API declaration
counts remain 552 public and 127 internal across 257 source modules.

| Inline profile | Before gzip | After gzip | Increment |
| -------------- | ----------: | ---------: | --------: |
| Default        |    41,326 B |   41,745 B |     419 B |
| Lean           |    31,292 B |   31,361 B |      69 B |
| With route     |    43,512 B |   43,955 B |     443 B |
| With fragments |    45,092 B |   45,820 B |     728 B |

The fragment-enabled profile grows by 2,334 raw bytes and 679 Brotli bytes.
The lean increment comes from shared cache accessors and observed boundary
attributes; it does not include fragment targeting. Bundle ceilings retain
their existing margins over these paired measurements, using the same
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH and repository build and compression scripts.

The one-worker benchmark in `tests/benchmarks/nested-fragments.bench.ts`
measured cached planning for one content edit at about 0.0009 ms with 10
children and 0.0044 ms with 100 children (1.16 million and 225 thousand calls
per second). It excludes cache construction, precise diffing, DOM morphing,
network requests and browser paint. Nested pages need precise diffing even
without patch permissions; the existing detailed diff measurements above
show why planning time alone is not an end-to-end overhead measurement.
Ordinary boundaries do not enable detailed diffing solely for this feature.

Focused validation covered 176 tests across 12 files using one worker:
child targeting and fallbacks, parent/child races, sibling independence and
widget state, initially empty lists, direct bindings, Lexical leaves, recovery,
cache refresh, observers and scheduler replay/deadlines. The full suite and
browser benchmarks were not rerun. Typecheck, lint, architecture and bundle
gates passed. Generated API reports retain the pre-existing replay-store link
warnings and forgotten-export baseline mismatch (50 reviewed versus 181 actual);
this step adds no new API warning debt.
