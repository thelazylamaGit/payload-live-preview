# Hybrid preview: patch, fragment, route

Patching (the default) edits the elements a page already renders. Two
things it cannot do: create markup that a template renders only when a
field is set, and run a component's own logic (derived values, custom
blocks, conditional sections). The **fragment** strategy asks your server
to render one component boundary from the unsaved form state and morphs
the result in — focus, typed values and open `<details>` survive, as with
every keyed morph
([ADR 0008 — Keyed morph: what it keeps, what it never crosses](architecture/0008-keyed-morph-ownership.md)).
The **route** strategy refreshes the whole route when nothing smaller is
safe. The protocol and its abuse model are recorded in
[ADR 0011 — The fragment protocol and its abuse model](architecture/0011-fragment-protocol-and-abuse-model.md).

A boundary is also the least markup this package can be used with: one
attribute per component instead of one per field, with the fidelity of a full
render inside it. That trade — and when field bindings are still the better
answer — is
[bindings.md](bindings.md#how-much-markup-this-actually-needs).

## Marking a boundary

```astro
<section data-payload-fragment="hero" data-payload-depends="title,tagline,body">
  <h1 data-payload-field="title">{title}</h1>
  {tagline && <p class="lede">{tagline}</p>}
  <p>{wordCount(body)} words</p>
</section>
```

- `data-payload-fragment="hero"` — a **registry id** (`[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`).
  Never a path or a module name: the server decides what `hero` renders.
  `createPreviewBindings().boundary('hero', { dependsOn: [...] })` writes these
  three attributes from the request's authorization, so an unauthorized response
  carries no boundary either ([bindings.md](bindings.md#keeping-binding-attributes-off-public-responses)).
- `data-payload-depends` — the fields that re-render the boundary. Without
  it, every update does.
- `data-payload-fragment-key` — when one id renders several boundaries on a
  page (one per list item, say).
- Bindings inside the boundary still work as the **fallback**: if the
  server cannot render (network, timeout, refusal, bad response), the
  runtime patches them from the same revision and reports an `LP08xx`
  code. The editor never sees stale content presented as current.

A boundary inside an island (`<astro-island>`, `data-payload-island`) is the
island's business and is never rendered by the server.

## The endpoint

One endpoint, one binding per component system. What differs is the import, the
shape the framework hands a route handler, and which renderer is loaded; the
protocol, the authorization, the limits and the registry lookup are the same
code underneath all four.

| Framework     | Import                           | Route file                                            | Renders with          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Astro         | `payload-live-preview/astro`     | `src/pages/payload/fragment.ts` (`prerender = false`) | `astro/container`     |
| Next.js       | `payload-live-preview/nextjs`    | `app/payload/fragment/route.ts`                       | `react-dom/server`    |
| SvelteKit     | `payload-live-preview/sveltekit` | `src/routes/payload/fragment/+server.ts`              | `svelte/server`       |
| Nuxt          | `payload-live-preview/nuxt`      | `server/routes/payload/fragment.post.ts`              | `vue/server-renderer` |
| Anything else | any of them, plus `render`       | that framework's POST route                           | your function         |

### Astro

The endpoint authorizes with the same hook as the page. Define it once and
hand it to both:

```ts
// src/lib/authorize-preview.ts — server-only
import { authorizePreviewRequest } from 'payload-live-preview/server';

export const authorizePreview = (request: Request) =>
  authorizePreviewRequest(request, {
    type: 'payload-session',
    serverURL: import.meta.env.PAYLOAD_URL,
  });
```

```ts
// src/pages/payload/fragment.ts
import { createFragmentEndpoint } from 'payload-live-preview/astro';
import Hero from '../../components/Hero.astro';
import { authorizePreview } from '../../lib/authorize-preview';

export const prerender = false;

export const POST = createFragmentEndpoint({
  authorizePreview,
  registry: {
    hero: {
      component: Hero,
      props: ({ fields, locale }) => ({
        title: String(fields.title ?? ''),
        tagline: typeof fields.tagline === 'string' ? fields.tagline : undefined,
        body: fields.body,
        locale,
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

### Next.js

The same endpoint as an App Router route handler. `defineFragment()` pairs a
component with the props it takes, so a renamed prop is a type error here
instead of an empty boundary in the preview:

```ts
// app/payload/fragment/route.ts
import { createFragmentEndpoint, defineFragment } from 'payload-live-preview/nextjs';
import { Hero } from '@/components/Hero';
import { authorizePreview } from '@/lib/authorize-preview';

export const POST = createFragmentEndpoint({
  authorizePreview,
  registry: {
    hero: defineFragment(Hero, ({ fields, locale }) => ({
      title: String(fields.title ?? ''),
      tagline: typeof fields.tagline === 'string' ? fields.tagline : undefined,
      locale,
    })),
  },
});
```

Rendered with `renderToString()` from `react-dom/server`, which renders one
synchronous component: a server component that awaits its own data is not one
of these — read what it needs in `props`, which may be async, and keep the
component itself synchronous. `react` and `react-dom` are optional peers
imported at the first render, so a project that registers no fragment never
loads them.

### SvelteKit

`+server.ts` exports the endpoint as its `POST`; the handler takes the event
SvelteKit hands it.

```ts
// src/routes/payload/fragment/+server.ts
import { createFragmentEndpoint } from 'payload-live-preview/sveltekit';
import Hero from '$lib/Hero.svelte';
import { heroProps } from '$lib/hero';
import { authorizePreview } from '$lib/authorize-preview';

export const POST = createFragmentEndpoint({
  authorizePreview,
  registry: { hero: { component: Hero, props: ({ fields }) => heroProps(fields) } },
});
```

Rendered with `render()` from `svelte/server`, and only its `body`: what a
component puts in `<svelte:head>` belongs to the document head, which the route
strategy owns. `svelte` is an optional peer imported at the first render.

That import names `svelte/server` outright, unlike the other bindings' hidden
specifiers, and it has to: Svelte keeps the current component context in a
module variable, and a component compiled by Vite reaches it through Vite's own
module graph. A copy resolved past the bundler would be a second instance with
an empty context, and every render would fail on it. If one ever does — a build
that externalizes this package without also externalizing `svelte`, say — add
`ssr: { noExternal: ['payload-live-preview'] }` to `vite.config.ts` so both come
from the same graph.

### Nuxt

Nitro hands a route handler an H3 event rather than a `Request`, so the endpoint
is wrapped once:

```ts
// server/routes/payload/fragment.post.ts
import { createFragmentEndpoint } from 'payload-live-preview/nuxt';
import Hero from '../../../components/Hero.vue';
import { heroProps } from '../../../lib/hero';

const endpoint = createFragmentEndpoint({
  authorize: { type: 'signed-token', secret: TOKEN_SECRET, audience: SITE_ORIGIN },
  registry: { hero: { component: Hero, props: ({ fields }) => heroProps(fields) } },
});

export default defineEventHandler((event) => endpoint(toWebRequest(event)));
```

Rendered with `renderToString()` from `vue/server-renderer`, one SSR app per
render because an app carries the props it was created with. `vue` is an
optional peer imported at the first render.

One build note: the component is rendered inside the Nitro bundle, and Nitro's
rollup does not know what a single-file component is. Teach it once —

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';
export default defineNuxtConfig({ nitro: { rollupConfig: { plugins: [vue()] } } });
```

— or write the fragment's component as a `defineComponent` in a `.ts` file,
which Nitro reads as it is.

### Another component system

`render` replaces the binding's renderer and leaves the rest of the endpoint
alone. Import the one whose route shape matches your framework — its component
type is `object` everywhere except Next.js, so a Solid, Qwik or Lit component
fits — and the default renderer is only imported when it actually runs, so a
project that passes `render` never loads the peer it would have used:

```ts
import { createFragmentEndpoint } from 'payload-live-preview/astro';
import { createSSRApp, type Component } from 'vue';
import { renderToString } from 'vue/server-renderer';
import Hero from './Hero.vue';

export const POST = createFragmentEndpoint({
  authorize: { type: 'signed-token', secret: TOKEN_SECRET, audience: SITE_ORIGIN },
  registry: {
    hero: { component: Hero, props: ({ fields }) => ({ title: String(fields.title ?? '') }) },
  },
  render: (component, props) => renderToString(createSSRApp(component as Component, props)),
});
```

The response then reports `renderer: 'custom'` in its metadata. A framework
whose route handler is not `Request` → `Response` wraps the returned function
in whatever it does hand a handler — that is all either binding does.

### What both decide

- **Registry**: the only things the endpoint can render. Props are computed
  on the server from the request's fields; nothing in the request selects
  code.
- **Authorization**: `authorizePreview` is the middleware's hook — same type,
  same rules; a context `authorizePreviewRequest()` produced authorizes,
  anything else refuses. When there is no hook to share, `authorize` takes a
  strategy instead, exactly as `authorizePreviewRequest()` does
  (`authorize: { type: 'signed-token', secret: import.meta.env.PREVIEW_TOKEN_SECRET, audience: import.meta.env.SITE_ORIGIN }`).
  One of the two is required and they are exclusive. The endpoint
  authorizes the **page route** the browser reports, with the request's own
  cookies and query, so a token stays bound to the route it was issued for
  and a session is the visitor's own. There is no unsigned endpoint.
  The strategies are described in [docs/authorization.md](authorization.md).
- **Renderer**: the imported binding's own, loaded once per process at the
  first render and forgotten again if that import failed, so a project that
  installs the peer afterwards is not answered from a stale failure. Pass
  `render` for another component system or for a test.
- **Limits**: body 64 KiB, render timeout 5 s, and field depth 64, configurable
  through `limits` (`bodyBytes`, `timeoutMs`, `fieldDepth`). `fieldDepth` must be
  an integer from 0 to 64; invalid configuration throws when the endpoint is created.
  For example, use `limits: { fieldDepth: 24 }` for a stricter cap. Depth starts
  at 0 for `fields`; each object property or array element adds one level,
  including primitive values. The hard ceiling bounds validation before authorization.
  Requests exceeding the depth limit receive `400 {"error":"field-depth","maxDepth":64}`
  (or the configured cap); other invalid request shapes receive `400 {"error":"shape"}`.
  Every response is `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
- **A render that throws** answers `500 {"error":"render"}` — the reason never
  leaves the server — and logs the boundary's id and the message once per
  process, outside production. Without that line a component that throws on
  every request looks like a network fault from the browser. The runtime
  patches the boundary from the same revision and reports `LP0801`.

### What a deployment needs

- A route the framework actually serves. In Astro, files under `src/pages/`
  whose path starts with `_` are private and never routed, so the endpoint
  belongs at `src/pages/payload/fragment.ts` (`/payload/fragment`), not under
  `_payload`. In Next.js it is `app/payload/fragment/route.ts`, and the path
  follows the directory.
- A server to render in: an Astro SSR adapter (`@astrojs/node`, Vercel, …)
  with `prerender = false` on the route, or a Next.js deployment that is not a
  fully static export. A static-only build has no process; run the endpoint as
  a separate preview rendering service on the same origin (a reverse proxy
  path) if the site itself is static.
- Rate limiting at the edge or proxy for the endpoint path: each request
  renders a component. The endpoint bounds work per request (limits above)
  but does not count requests per client.
- Same-origin only. A request whose `Sec-Fetch-Site` is anything but
  `same-origin` (or `none`) is refused before `Origin` is read, and the
  runtime's fragment client only posts to a path on the page's own origin.
  `allowedOrigins` on the endpoint admits a named `Origin` only for a client
  that sends no `Sec-Fetch-Site`; it does not open the endpoint to a preview
  page served elsewhere.

## Turning it on in the page

Astro, request-time injection:

```ts
// src/middleware.ts
import { createLivePreviewMiddleware } from 'payload-live-preview/astro';
import { authorizePreview } from './lib/authorize-preview';

export const onRequest = createLivePreviewMiddleware({
  allowedOrigins: [import.meta.env.PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_ADMIN_ORIGIN],
  authorizePreview,
  fragments: { endpoint: '/payload/fragment' },
});
```

With `fragments` set, the injected script carries a small prelude with the
fragment client ahead of the runtime; a page without it gets the runtime
alone. The Astro integration (`livePreview()`) takes the same option in every
mode; loader mode emits the prelude in the bootstrap, and the runtime asset
stays the same for every page. Every adapter takes the same
`fragments` option — `livePreviewScriptProps()` in a Next.js layout
([nextjs.md](nextjs.md)), the SvelteKit handle, the Nuxt plugin — because the
option only names a path the runtime posts to, whoever serves it.
`generateInlineScript()` calls it `fragmentEndpoint`. `LivePreviewClient` takes
`strategies` instead:
`{ fragment: createFragmentStrategy({ endpoint }), route: createRouteStrategy() }`
from `payload-live-preview/fragment`.

### The route strategy on its own

A page that wants route refreshes and no server-rendered boundaries sets
`routeStrategy: true` instead — in `generateInlineScript()` and in every
adapter's options. The script then carries a second, smaller prelude with the
route strategy alone: 2 176 bytes gzip against the fragment prelude's 3 753,
because the endpoint request, the fragment protocol and its abort scaffolding
stay behind.

That is the option for `data-payload-strategy="route"` and for bindings in
`<head>` on a page whose script names no fragment endpoint. Setting
both is not an error and not a double cost: `fragmentEndpoint` wins, and its
prelude already contains the route strategy.

## A change nothing binds

Patching reaches what the markup annotates. Edit a field with no
`data-payload-field` anywhere and the preview shows the old value — the runtime
has nowhere to put the new one. A framework hook that re-renders the component
tree does not have that failure mode, and that is the one thing it does better.

A strategy to escalate to closes it, and nothing else is needed — escalating is
what `onUnfaithfulPatch` does by default:

```ts
// astro.config.mjs reads process.env: import.meta.env has no PUBLIC_ variables there (docs/astro.md)
livePreview({
  allowedOrigins: [process.env.PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_ADMIN_ORIGIN],
  serverURL: process.env.PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_ADMIN_ORIGIN,
  mergeDepth: 1,
  routeStrategy: true,
});
```

A revision that changes a field no binding covers then refreshes the whole
route, and the editor sees the edit. Where a binding exists the page is still
patched in place, with focus and scroll intact.

The same decision covers the other ways a patch falls short of the server's own
render: a value no renderer can represent, and a Lexical block whose markup the
write has to drop. Those name an element, so they escalate to the fragment
boundary around it when there is one, and to the route when there is not — once
per element, because the cause is the markup rather than the edit.

What counts as covered: a binding on the field, on the same field under the
message's locale suffix, or on a path inside it — `data-payload-field="hero.eyebrow"`
covers the field `hero`, because the diff names top-level fields. The document
fields Payload sends with every update (`id`, `updatedAt`, `_status` and their
kin) never count, and neither does the connection's first message, where every
field looks changed and the page was just rendered from them.

The refresh is throttled by the route strategy's own `minIntervalMs` (1 s by
default), and a revision refreshes at most once — a second attempt is refused
as `LP0805`. A page that binds little and edits much will still refresh often;
that is the trade, and `onUnfaithfulPatch: 'warn'` is the other side of it: the
same findings, reported as `LP0411`, with the patch left where it is.

## What you observe

- `fragmentRender` events per boundary and revision (`rendered` / `failed`
  with the code); `afterUpdate` carries `source: 'fragment'` once the
  revision's fragments settled, next to the `source: 'patch'` one for the
  rest of the page.
- `inspect().fragments`: `{ handler, inFlight, rendered, failed, superseded }`.
- `inspect().fidelity`: `{ mode, unfaithful, escalated, fields }` — every
  finding of this kind, and how many of them a strategy was handed: the patches
  the runtime knew could not match the server (LP0411), once per binding, and
  the changed fields it had no binding for at all, once per field.
  `unfaithful` above `escalated` with both `handler`s `false` is a page that
  keeps degraded patches for want of a strategy.
- Codes: `LP0801` request failed (network, timeout, or any non-2xx status
  but 401/403 — the endpoint's own 400, 404, 405, 413, 415 and 500 too) · `LP0802`
  response invalid (type, shape, size, wrong boundary) · `LP0803` endpoint
  refused (401/403) · `LP0804` a late response for a superseded revision
  was discarded · `LP0805` a route refresh was refused by the loop guard ·
  `LP0806` a boundary asks for `fragment` but no client is configured —
  patched instead.

## The route strategy

Some markup no boundary can own: the document head (title, meta), the
layout, route params, global providers. A binding there — anything in
`<head>`, or an element marked `data-payload-strategy="route"` (with
`data-payload-depends` naming its fields) — makes the revision a **route
refresh**: the runtime fetches the current URL again (same cookies and
query, header `x-payload-live-preview: route`), syncs `<title>`, `<meta>`
and the canonical link, morphs `<body>` in place (islands and custom
elements are boundaries it does not cross; focus, typed values and scroll
survive), rescans, and re-applies the revision so the unsaved state lands on
the fresh markup. The head sync mirrors the fresh document both ways: a
named `<meta>` or the canonical `<link>` that the server no longer renders
is removed, because the refresh is that server's own render of this URL.
Mark a tag your own script owns with `data-payload-owned` and the sync
leaves it alone in both directions. At most one refresh per revision; a
second request for the same revision, or one inside `minIntervalMs` (1 s) of
the previous, is refused with `LP0805` and the elements are patched instead.
A failed refresh (`LP0801`/`LP0802`) also falls back to patching.

The route strategy needs no endpoint: with `fragments` configured the
injected prelude carries it (`createRouteStrategy()` from
`payload-live-preview/fragment` for `LivePreviewClient` users). The server
sees a normal GET for the page, so anything that renders the page renders
the refresh.

## How a binding's strategy is chosen

In this order, and nothing else decides:

1. An explicit `data-payload-strategy` (`patch`, `fragment`, `route`; any
   other value is left alone with `LP0407`).
2. A binding inside a `data-payload-fragment` boundary belongs to the
   fragment (patched only as its fallback).
3. A binding in `<head>` belongs to the route.
4. Everything else is patched.

Several dirty fields in one revision are coalesced: each boundary renders
once if any of its `data-payload-depends` (or, without it, any field)
changed, the runtime `dependencies` option counts (a boundary depending on a
derived field re-renders when its source changes), and the route refreshes
once. `inspect().route` reports
`{ handler, refreshes, failed, refused, loopStopped }`.

The strategy refreshes at most once per `minIntervalMs` (1 000 ms). A request
inside that window is not dropped: it is counted in `refused`, the page is
patched with what it can show in the meantime, and the refresh runs once when
the window closes — so the keystroke that ends a burst still reaches the
preview. A newer revision takes that pending run over, because its message
carries the older one's values too.

## Islands on the same page

A hydrated island (`<astro-island>`, `data-payload-island`) keeps owning its
subtree: patching skips it, a fragment boundary inside it is never planned,
the route morph stops at it, and it re-renders itself from a
`payload-live-preview:update` event — or with the official
`@payloadcms/live-preview-react`/`-vue` hook if that is what renders it
([docs/interop.md](interop.md)). The event follows every flush that carried a
change, whether or not a binding outside the islands was written — a page whose
bindings all sit inside islands still hears every edit
([docs/renderers.md](renderers.md#islands)). Patch boundaries, fragment boundaries and
hook islands coexist on one page.

## Revision discipline

One revision per admin message. A newer message aborts the previous
revision's fragment requests; a response that arrives late is discarded;
identical boundaries in one revision share a request; at most four
requests run at once (`maxConcurrent` on `createFragmentStrategy()`). Slow
fragment A can never overwrite fast fragment B.

## Direct bindings inside a fragment

`preview.boundary(id, { dependsOn, patchFields })` explicitly permits **exact bound
field paths** to update without re-rendering that boundary. The declaration is a
promise that those values have no other server-rendered effects there: do not opt
in a field used for conditional markup, layout, or server calculations. A binding
alone never grants permission. Native text bindings use this contract too.

For example, with the existing request-authorized `preview` helper and fragment
endpoint, an Astro block list can expose only its safe text and colour slots:

```astro
---
// `preview` is the existing createPreviewBindings({ authorization, owner }) helper.
const { page, preview } = Astro.props;
const patchFields = page.blocks.flatMap((_, index) => [
  `blocks.${index}.caption`,
  `blocks.${index}.colour`,
]);
const defaultColour = '#0008';
---
<section {...preview.owner()} {...preview.boundary('page-blocks', {
  dependsOn: ['blocks'],
  patchFields,
})}>
  {page.blocks.map((block, index) => (
    <article data-payload-key={block.id}>
      <p {...preview.bind(`blocks.${index}.caption`)}>{block.caption}</p>
      <div
        {...preview.bind(`blocks.${index}.colour`, {
          cssProperty: 'background-color',
          cssDefault: defaultColour,
        })}
        style={`background-color: ${block.colour || defaultColour}`}
      />
    </article>
  ))}
</section>
```

Keep rendering your existing block components in the fragment endpoint, and have
those components emit the same indexed bindings. `patchFields` uses the existing
dotted field paths, including numeric array indices; it has no wildcards and does
not inherit permission to descendants. `bindByPath` drops array indices, so use
`bind` for an indexed instance. Arrays need stable item `id`s for direct edits;
without them changes conservatively render on the server. Reordering, insertion,
removal, block-type changes, unknown or unbound paths, initial synchronisation and
forced renders keep the server path. Reordering refreshes bindings immediately.
New slots beyond the declared indices remain server-rendered until the boundary's
configuration is updated (for example, by a page render).

If an affected boundary has any server work, it renders once and its inner
bindings are left alone. Other boundaries can patch independently. A newer direct
edit takes over pending server work with the latest fields; it cannot drop an
unfinished image edit, and superseded responses cannot apply.

`cssProperty: 'background-color'` selects the built-in `hexColor` renderer. This is
the only supported CSS property. It accepts `#rgb`, `#rgba`, `#rrggbb` and
`#rrggbbaa`, including alpha. `null` or `''` uses `cssDefault`; without a default it
removes just the inline background colour, revealing stylesheet/inherited
behaviour. Use the same fallback in your server render. A missing field retains
the usual runtime handling. Invalid/intermediate colours and invalid defaults
leave the DOM unchanged. CSS expressions, named colours, other properties and
complete `style` attribute writes are not enabled. Raw attributes are
`data-payload-type="hexColor"`, `data-payload-css-property="background-color"` and
optional `data-payload-css-default="#0008"`.

Scheduling retains its defaults: the leading frame, 50 ms debounce and maximum
wait of four debounce windows. On pages opting into `patchFields`, pending frames and maximum-wait deadlines survive
new revisions, so sustained dragging continues to display the latest values.
There is no extra runtime on public pages: the existing authorization helper
suppresses both the boundary configuration and colour-binding attributes.
Without `patchFields`, fragment routing retains its existing behaviour.
